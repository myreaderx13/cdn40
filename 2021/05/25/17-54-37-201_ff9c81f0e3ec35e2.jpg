The company is truly global with employees across the world \u2014 and it did that before COVID-19 made remote working cool.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Things got so much better when we stopped viewing ourselves as a Silicon Valley company. We basically said, no, we&#8217;re just a global company,&#8221; CEO David Barrett told TechCrunch. That globalism led to it opening a major office in \u2014 of all places \u2014a small town in rural Michigan. That Ironwood expansion would eventually lead to a cultural makeover that would see the company broadly abandon its focus on the Bay Area, expanding from a headquarters in Portland to offices around the globe.<\/p>\n<p>It makes sense that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/10\/expensify-ec1-origin\/\">a company founded by internet pirates<\/a> would let its workforce live anywhere they please and however they want to. Yet, how does it manage to make it all work well enough to reach $100 million in annual revenue with just a tad more than 100 employees?<\/p>\n<p>As I described in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/18\/expensify-ec1-culture\/\">Part 2 of this EC-1<\/a>, that staffing efficiency is partly due to its culture and who it hires. It&#8217;s also because it has attracted top talent from across the world by giving them benefits like the option to work remotely all year as well as paying SF-level salaries even to those not based in the tech hub. It&#8217;s also got annual fully paid month-long &#8220;workcations&#8221; for every employee, their partner and kids.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the real story is how a company can become untethered from its original geography, willing to adapt to new places and new cultures, and ultimately, give up the past while building the future.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Expensify may be the most ambitious software company ever to mostly abandon the Bay Area as the center of its operations.

huge surprises &#8212; but there&#8217;s one announcement that will surely make developers&#8217; ears perk up: The company is now using OpenAI&#8217;s massive GPT-3 natural language model in its no-code\/low-code Power Apps service to translate spoken text into code in its recently announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform\/\">Power Fx language<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now don&#8217;t get carried away. You&#8217;re not going to develop the next TikTok while only using natural language. Instead, what Microsoft is doing here is taking some of the low-code aspects of a tool like Power Apps and using AI to essentially turn those into no-code experiences, too. For now, the focus here is on Power Apps formulas, which despite the low-code nature of the service, is something you&#8217;ll have to write sooner or later if you want to build an app of any sophistication.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Using an advanced AI model like this can help our low-code tools become even more widely available to an even bigger audience by truly becoming what we call no code,&#8221; said Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president for Microsoft\u2019s low-code application platform.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8I6xrknY62\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform\/\">Microsoft launches Power Fx, a new open source low-code language<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Microsoft launches Power Fx, a new open source low-code language&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform\/embed\/#?secret=8I6xrknY62\" data-secret=\"8I6xrknY62\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In practice, this looks like the citizen programmer writing &#8220;find products where the name starts with &#8216;kids&#8217; &#8221; &#8212; and Power Apps then rendering that as <em>&#8220;Filter(\u2018BC Orders\u2019 Left(\u2018Product Name\u2019,4)=&#8221;Kids&#8221;)&#8221;<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Because Microsoft is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/22\/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership\/\">an investor in OpenAI<\/a>, it&#8217;s no surprise the company chose its model to power this experience.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2156679\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2156679\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2156679\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2156679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Microsoft<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while this makes programming easier, Microsoft itself stresses that users still have to understand the logic of the application they are building. &#8220;The features don\u2019t replace the need for a person to understand the code they are implementing but are designed to assist people who are learning the Power Fx programming language and help them choose the right formulas to get the result they need. That can dramatically expand access to more advanced app building and more rapidly train people to use low code tools,&#8221; the company explains in today&#8217;s announcement.<\/p>\n<p>To some degree, this isn&#8217;t all that different from using the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/power-bi\/natural-language\/q-and-a-intro\">natural language query functions<\/a> that are now available in tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcommunity.microsoft.com\/t5\/excel-blog\/introducing-natural-language-queries-in-ideas\/ba-p\/1594687\">Excel<\/a>, PowerBI or <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/ai-machine-learning\/analyzing-text-in-a-google-sheet-using-cloud-natural-language-api-and-apps-script\">Google Sheets<\/a>. These, too, translate natural language into a formula, after all. GPT-3 is probably a bit more sophisticated than this and capable of understanding more complex queries, but translating natural language into formulas isn&#8217;t all that new.<\/p>\n<p>The long-term promise here, though, is for tools like this to become smarter over time and be able to handle more complicated programming tasks. But that&#8217;s a big step up from what is essentially a translation problem, though. More complex queries require more of an understanding of a program as a whole. A formula, for the most part, is a pretty self-contained statement but a similar model that could generate &#8220;real&#8221; code would have to contend with a lot more context.<\/p>\n<p>These new features will go live in public preview in English to users in North America by the end of June.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3g2FyWL9bu\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/07\/no-code-will-define-the-next-generation-of-software\/\">&#8216;No code&#8217;

fraud is, too. Now, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forter.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forter<\/a>, one of the startups building a business to tackle that malicious activity, has closed $300 million in funding &#8212; a sign both of the size of the issue and its success in tackling it to date.<\/p>\n<p>The new funding, a Series F, values Forter at $3 billion &#8212; notable not least because the funding is\u00a0coming only about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forter.com\/blog\/expansion-fraud-fighting-network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">six months since Forter&#8217;s previous round<\/a>, a $125 million Series E that valued it at over $1.3 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Tiger Global Management is leading this latest equity infusion, with new backers Third Point Ventures and Adage Capital Management, and existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, March Capital, NewView Capital, Salesforce Ventures and Scale Venture Partners, also involved.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The plan will be to use to the money to expand Forter &#8212; founded in Tel Aviv and now based in New York &#8212; geographically, bring more functionality into its product and explore adjacent areas where Forter might expand its capabilities, either organically or by way of acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>Forter today focuses mainly on identifying fraud at the point of transaction and building an AI-based platform that &#8220;learns&#8221; more behaviors to improve its accuracy; it also builds models that keep more people transacting and helps bring down the number of &#8220;false positives&#8221; where activity that appears suspicious actually is not.<\/p>\n<p>One area on its roadmap for expansion is remediation after the fraud occurs, said Liron Damri, Forter&#8217;s co-founder and president.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our vision is to serve the merchant as the go-to trusted partner for everything, so remediation is definitely on our roadmap,&#8221; he said of potential acquisition targets.<\/p>\n<p>Damri, who co-founded the company with Michael Reitblat, CEO, and Alon Shemesh, chief analyst, said in an interview that the startup &#8212; which works with some 350 large customers like Priceline and Instacart and a growing number of service providers like FreedomPay and Flutterwave, altogether seeing some $250 billion worth of transactions globally last year &#8212; wasn&#8217;t proactively looking for more money.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All we wanted to do was go back to run the company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But in the past six months we\u2019ve seen such a great momentum, doubling revenue and ARR, and seeing our customer volumes grow.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That led to a lot of investors proactively reaching out and asking questions, he continued. He described Tiger as a &#8220;kingmaker&#8221; in the category of e-commerce, so it was an easy decision to make, and gave it the &#8220;gas&#8221; it needed to take its next growth steps.<\/p>\n<p>E-commerce has been one of the major technology growth stories of the last year, fueled by a rush of consumers and businesses playing out their lives online at a time when it has been harder, and in some cases impossible, to transact in person.<\/p>\n<p>While we have definitely seen a lot of growth, and growing sophistication, in the number of tools on the market to combat cybercrime, it&#8217;s in some ways an ouroboros of a problem: The more transactions that are made, the more there are that need to be monitored for suspicious activity. And in any case, fraud in e-commerce is not exactly going away. It&#8217;s estimated that it will cost retailers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210425005002\/en\/Juniper-Research-eCommerce-Losses-to-Online-Payment-Fraud-to-Exceed-20-Billion-Annually-in-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some $20 billion in 2021<\/a> and is always on the rise.<\/p>\n<p>Forter got its start in 2013 focusing first on monitoring activity on sites wherever customers happened to be to identify suspicious behavior &#8212; a sign that it might be a bot or someone on an illicit spending spree racking up a lot of items in quick succession &#8212; with the bigger concept being to build a network of activity from which to learn and help make more informed decisions over time.<\/p>\n<p>In more recent years, the essence of the issue has expanded somewhat, and also grown more sophisticated. As companies have grown their businesses to reach beyond early adopters and core audiences, and into a more &#8220;omnichannel&#8221; environment beyond basic check-outs on their own sites, so too have the kinds of consumers coming to shop.<\/p>\n<p>This has meant that traditional &#8220;signals&#8221; of legitimate buyers no longer were the same as before &#8212; a predicament that really rose in profile in the last year, as many newcomers came to e-commerce for the first time during the pandemic. In fact, Damri told me that in 2020 there were seven times more &#8220;newcomers&#8221; to sites than in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>So with most of the flagging of suspicious activity coming up at the point of transaction, Forter expanded to analyzing activity there.<\/p>\n<p>As with a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/14\/stripe-acquires-bouncer-will-integrate-its-card-authentication-into-the-radar-fraud-detection-tool\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent acquisition of Stripe&#8217;s, Bouncer<\/a>, to build out its own anti-fraud product, a large part of Forter&#8217;s attention these days is on providing tools to companies to identify suspicious purchasing, but even more than that, to make sure that the many occasions that might look suspicious are not, to help reduce the amount of &#8220;cart abandonment&#8221; and increase conversions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CmKPF4gZPl\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/21\/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce\/\">5 predictions for the future of e-commerce<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;5 predictions for the future of e-commerce&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/21\/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce\/embed\/#?secret=CmKPF4gZPl\" data-secret=\"CmKPF4gZPl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The old way of doing things, Damri said, involved &#8220;thousands of rules and applying suspicion on everyone. You were guilty unless proved otherwise.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Using its AI engine and some risk analysis (not unlike the kind that, say, an insurance or loan provider might apply in their businesses), Forter turned the proposition on its head.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to approve as much as possible. We wanted to gradually increase the trust you have of your own customers. We changed the sentiment and approach&#8230; especially in areas that were neglected, such as those who saw significant changes in life,&#8221; Damri said. &#8220;This was extremely important as COVID-19 hit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Forter&#8217;s risk tolerance model, it seems, has so far proven out.

into their services by way of APIs &#8212; has been on a steady funding and acquisitions march in the last several months to scale its business, and today comes the latest development on that front.<\/p>\n<p>The company has <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/sinch-ab-publ-sinch-completes-220300243.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that it has raised another $1.1 billion in a direct share issue, with significant chunks of that funding coming from Temasek and SoftBank, in order to continue building its business.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, the company &#8212; which is traded on the Swedish stock exchange Nasdaq Stockhom and currently has a market cap of around $11 billion &#8212; said that it was making a new share issue of 7,232,077 shares at SEK 1,300 per share, raising approximately SEK 9.4 billion (equivalent to around $1.1 billion at current rates).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Sinch said that investors buying the shares included &#8220;selected Swedish and international investors of institutional character,&#8221; highlighting that Temasek and SB Management (a direct subsidiary of SoftBank Group Corp.) would\u00a0 respectively take SEK 2,085 million and 0.7 million shares. This works out to a $252 million investment for Temasek, and $110 million for SoftBank.<\/p>\n<p>SoftBank last December took a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/softbank-takes-a-690m-stake-in-cloud-based-swedish-crm-company-sinch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$690 million stake in Sinch<\/a> (when it was valued <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/17\/sinch-inteliquent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at $8.2 billion). That was just ahead of the company scooping<\/a> up Inteliquent in the U.S. in January for $1.14 billion to move a little closer to Twilio&#8217;s home turf.<\/p>\n<p>Sinch is not saying much more beyond the announcement of the share issue for now, except that the raise was made to shore up its financial position ahead of more M&amp;A activity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sinch has an active M&amp;A-agenda and a track record of successful acquisitions, making [it] well placed to drive continued consolidation of the messaging and [communications platform as a service, CPaaS] market,&#8221; it said in a short statement. &#8220;Furthermore, the increased financial flexibility that the directed new share issue entails further strengthens the Company\u2019s position as a relevant and competitive buyer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company is profitable and active in more than 40 markets, and <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.sinch.com\/static-files\/6d18a742-dd9f-40af-a973-ff69163aa56b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CEO Oscar Werner said in Sinch&#8217;s most recent earnings report<\/a> that in the last quarter alone that its communications APIs &#8212; which works across\u00a0 channels like SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, chatbots, voice and video &#8212; handled 40 billion mobile messages.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Notably, its strategy has a strong foothold in the U.S. because of the Inteliquent acquisition. It will be interesting to see how and if it continues to consolidate to build up market share in that part of the world, or whether it focuses elsewhere, given the heft of two very strong Asian investors now in its stable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecoming a leader in the U.S. voice market is key to establish Sinch as the leading global cloud communications platform,\u201d said Werner in January.<\/p>\n<p>While Sinch has focused much of its business, like Twilio, around an API-based model focused on communications services, its acquisition of Inteliquent also gave it access to a large, legacy Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) product set, aimed at telcos to provide off-net call termination (when a call is handed off from one carrier to another) and toll-free numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Tellingly, when Sinch acquired Inteliquent, the two divisions each accounted for roughly half of its total business, but the CPaaS business is growing at twice the rate of IaaS, which points to how Sinch views the future for itself, too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sinch &#8212;

antitrust suit against Amazon Tuesday, accusing the company of stifling competition by exerting control over third-party sellers.<\/p>\n<p>The lawsuit, filed in DC Superior Court, alleges that Amazon fixed prices on its massive online retail platform by blocking third-party sellers from selling their products for less elsewhere. Racine argues that this kind of arrangement means that sellers roll Amazon&#8217;s hefty fees into their prices, creating an &#8220;artificially high&#8221; price floor across the online retail market.<\/p>\n<p>That practice may run afoul of the District of Columbia\u2019s Antitrust Act. The AG&#8217;s office argues that the practice allows Amazon to exert monopoly power in online retail.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Amazon has used its dominant position in the online retail market to win at all costs. It maximizes its profits at the expense of third-party sellers and consumers, while harming competition, stifling innovation, and illegally tilting the playing field in its favor,&#8221; Racine said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We filed this antitrust lawsuit to put an end to Amazon\u2019s illegal control of prices across the online retail market.

In the short time since, the company has raised three increasingly large rounds: $4 million <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/whatnot-raises-4m-as-it-gets-into-livestreamed-auctions-and-pokemon-cards\/\">in December<\/a>, $20 million <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/04\/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles\/\">in March<\/a>, and, as of this morning, another $50 million.<\/p>\n<p>While Whatnot still offers the more standard product pages to give sellers a 24\/7 presence on the site, the livestreaming side of things has become the primary driver \u2014 by far. Co-founder Grant LaFontaine tells me that livestreaming is currently &#8220;95% of the focus&#8221;; it&#8217;s where most of their sales are happening, and what users seem to care most about.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing users seem to care about? Sports cards. Whatnot opened up the site to sports card sellers in January, and it almost immediately took over as the site&#8217;s best selling category. The one category now accounts for &#8220;millions of dollars&#8221; in sales each month, the company says.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"eg9TE4rB8R\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/04\/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles\/\">Whatnot raises $20M for its livestreaming platform built for selling Pok\u00e9mon cards and other collectibles<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Whatnot raises $20M for its livestreaming platform built for selling Pok\u00e9mon cards and other collectibles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/04\/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles\/embed\/#?secret=eg9TE4rB8R\" data-secret=\"eg9TE4rB8R\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Whatnot team itself is growing quickly as well. When I first spoke to them, it was just a handful of employees; by January of this year, they were up to ten. Today it&#8217;s 45 fulltimers. By the end of the year, says Grant, they expect to be nearing one hundred.<\/p>\n<p>While anyone can sell on Whatnot&#8217;s marketplace, only users that have been vetted\/invited can sell via livestream. This helps to keep fraud low; sellers know that if they try to sneak in fake cards or rip anyone off, their access to livestreaming \u2014 and thus their audience \u2014 could vanish.<\/p>\n<p>The company tells me that this Series B round was led by Anu Hariharan of Y Combinator Continuity fund, and backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Animal Capital, and a number of angels.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"f4nHzahoYS\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/05\/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines\/\">Whatnot wants to be the GOAT of collectible toys, starting with Funko Pops<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Whatnot wants to be the GOAT of collectible toys, starting with Funko Pops&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/05\/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines\/embed\/#?secret=f4nHzahoYS\" data-secret=\"f4nHzahoYS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whatnot exists with one primary goal in mind: to give people a place to buy and sell collectibles (like Pok\u00e9mon cards, sports cards, pins, etc) in a safe, authenticated way.

it&#8217;s a popular and well-used tool for organizing contacts and information, it doesn&#8217;t have all the answers when it comes to helping salespeople and marketers sell better, especially when meetings are not in person. Today, one of the startups that has emerged to help fill the gap is announcing a round of growth funding on the back of a huge year for its business.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.qualified.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qualified<\/a> &#8212; which builds better interactions for B2B sales and marketing teams that already use Salesforce by tapping into extra data sources to develop a better profile of those visiting your website, in aid of improving and personalizing the outreach (hence the name: you&#8217;re building <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lead_generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;qualified&#8221; leads<\/a>) &#8212; has picked up $51 million in funding. The startup will be using the Series B to continue building out its business with more functionality in the platform, and hiring across the board to expand business development and more.<\/p>\n<p>Led by Salesforce Ventures, the funding round also included Norwest Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures, both previous backers, among others. As with so many rounds at the moment &#8212; the venture world is flush with funding at the moment &#8212; this one is coming less than a year after Qualified&#8217;s last raise. It closed a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/04\/qualified-series-a\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$12 million Series A<\/a> in August of last year.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Qualified was co-founded by two Salesforce veterans &#8212; ex-Salesforce CMO Kraig Swensrud and ex-SVP of Salesforce.com Sean Whiteley &#8212; serial entrepreneurs who you could say have long been hammering away at the challenges of building digital tools for sales and marketing people to do their jobs better online. The pair have founded and sold two other startups filling holes to that end: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/12\/12\/getfeedback\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GetFeedback<\/a>, acquired by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/newsroom\/surveymonkey-to-acquire-getfeedback\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SurveyMonkey<\/a>; and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2006\/08\/21\/salesforce-dives-deep-into-google-adwords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kieden, acquired by Salesforce<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The gap that they&#8217;re aiming to fill with this latest venture is the fact that when sales and marketing teams want to connect with prospects directly through, say, a phone call, they might have all of that contact&#8217;s information at their disposal. But if those teams want to make a more engaged contact when someone is visiting their site &#8212; a sign that a person is actually interested and thinking already about engaging with a company &#8212; usually the sales and marketing teams are in the dark about who those visitors are.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We founded Qualified on the premise that a website should be more than a marketing brochure, but not just a sales site,&#8221; Swensrud, who is the CEO, said in an interview.<\/p>\n<p>Qualified has built a tool that essentially takes several signals from Salesforce as well as other places to build up some information about the site visitor. It then uses it to give the sales and marketing teams more of a steer so that when they reach out via a screen chat to say &#8220;how can I help?&#8221; they actually have more information and can target their questions in a better way. A sales or marketing rep might know which pages a person is also visiting, and can then use the conversation that starts with an online chat to progress to a voice or video call, or a meeting.<\/p>\n<p>If a person is already in your Salesforce rolodex, you get more information; but even without that there is some detail provided to be slightly less impersonal. (Example: when I logged into Qualified to look around the site, a chat popped up with a person greeting me &#8220;across the pond&#8221;&#8230; I&#8217;m in London.)<\/p>\n<p>Qualified also integrates with a number of other tools that are used to help source data and build its customer profiles, including <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Slack, Microsoft Teams, 6sense, Demandbase, Marketo, HubSpot, Oracle Eloqua, Clearbit, ZoomInfo and Outreach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Additional data is part and parcel of the kinds of information that sales and marketing people always need when reaching out to prospective customers, whether it&#8217;s via a &#8220;virtual&#8221; digital channel or in person. However, in the last year &#8212; where in-person meetings, team meetings, and working side-by-side with those who can give advice have all disappeared &#8212; having extra tools like these arguably have proven indispensable.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sales reps would heavily rely on their \u2018road warrior\u2019 image,&#8221; Swensrud said. &#8220;But all that stuff is gone, so as a result every seller is sitting at an office, at home, expecting digital interactions to happen that never existed before.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And it seems some believe that even outside of Covid-19 enforcing a different way of doing things, the trend for &#8220;virtual selling&#8221;, as it&#8217;s often called, is here to stay: Gartner forecasts that by 2025, some 80% of B2B sales interactions will take place in digital channels. (So long to the expense account lunch, I guess.)<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s because of the events of 2020, plus those bigger trends, that Qualified has seen revenues in the last year grow some 800% and its net customer revenue retention rate hover at 175%, with funding rounds come in relatively close succession in the wake of that.<\/p>\n<p>There is something interesting to Qualified that reminds me a bit of more targeted ad retargeting, as it were, and in that, you can imagine a lot of other opportunities for how Qualified might expand in scenarios where it would be more useful to know why someone is visiting your site, without outright asking them and bothering them with the question. That could include customer service, or even a version that might sell better to consumers coming to, say, a clothes site after reading something about orange being the new black.<\/p>\n<p>For now, though, it&#8217;s focused on the B2B opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of tools on the market that are competing with Salesforce as the go-to platform for people to organise and run CRM operations, but Swensrud is bullish for now on the idea of building specifically for the Salesforce ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our product is being driven by and runs on Salesforce,&#8221; he noted, pointing out that it&#8217;s through Salesforce that you&#8217;re able to go from chatting to a phone call by routing the information to the data you have on file there. &#8220;Our roots go very deep.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The funding round today is a sign that Salesforce is also happy with that close arrangement, which gives it a customization that its competitors lack.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cQualified represents an entirely new way for B2B companies to engage buyers,\u201d said Bill Patterson, EVP of CRM Applications at Salesforce, in a statement. \u201cWhen marketing and inbound sales teams use this solution with Sales Cloud&#8230; they see a notable impact on pipeline. We are thrilled about our growing partnership with Qualified and their success within the Salesforce ecosystem.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Salesforce dominates the world of CRM today, but while it&#8217;s a popular and well-used tool for organizing contacts and information, it doesn&#8217;t have all the answers when it comes to helping salespeople and marketers sell better, especially when meetings are not in person.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/former-disney-and-discovery-execs-to-launch-struum-a-classpass-for-streaming-services\/\">streaming service from former Disney and Discovery execs<\/a>, is today officially launching to the public. Unlike traditional on-demand streamers, such as Netflix, the Struum model is more akin to a &#8220;ClassPass for streaming,&#8221; as its plan is to aggregate content from smaller video services then provide access under its own subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the streaming landscape is dominated by larger subscription services, including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, HBO Max, Disney+, and YouTube, who together have a 75% share of the market, according to Nielsen. But Struum believes there&#8217;s a potential for another service powered by the long tail of\u00a0 the over 250 niche and speciality streamers.<\/p>\n<p>Many of these smaller services offer their own subscriptions, but will never achieve Netflix-size scale because of their more limited catalog and scope. Struum offers them an alternative path to revenue. Each month, Struum customers will pay a $4.99 subscription fee to access the Struum app where they&#8217;re then provided with 100 &#8220;credits&#8221; they can use to sample and consume content &#8212; just as ClassPass did with gym classes.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Over time, if the customer continues to use their subscription to routinely access content from one service, they can then opt to become a subscriber to that service from within the Struum app. This part of the business isn&#8217;t all that different from Amazon Prime Video Channels or others like it. But the difference is that Struum&#8217;s sampling model is what helped the customer discover the niche streamer in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Struum, meanwhile, generates its own revenue from customers&#8217; subscriptions, which it shares with its content partners. It won&#8217;t say what sort of cut it takes, however.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2156741\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2156741\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2156741\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg 751w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2156741\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Struum<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>At launch, there are more than 25 partners available through the Struum app, including Tastemade, Tribeca, Cheddar News, Kocowa, Dekkoo, Magellan TV, History Hit, Gusto, Young Hollywood, Indieflix, Filmbox, Echoboom Sports, Social Club TV, Cinedigm, Magnolia Pictures, Little Dot Studios, Group 9, Stingray and SPI\/Filmhub.<\/p>\n<p>Later this summer, the lineup will grow to more than 50 partners, with additions that include BBC SELECT, REVOLT, France Channels, InsightTV, Docubay, FuelTV, The Great Courses Signature Collection, Shout Factory TV, OUTtv, SVTV, CGOOD TV and Alchimie.<\/p>\n<p>In total, Struum&#8217;s partners will provide customers with access to tens of movies and TV shows across a range of categories and genres, like classic films, indies, foreign content, cult hits, lifestyle programming, reality, true crime, and more.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2156737\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2156737\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2156737\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg 751w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2156737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Struum<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Struum&#8217;s app guides users to their interests through a simple interface where it curates content into editorial groupings organized much like the rows of recommendations you&#8217;d find in Netflix.

And though that demand may be here to stay, it remains to be seen whether Struum&#8217;s ClassPass-like model makes the best sense for streaming&#8217;s long tail.<\/p>\n<p>Despite its unique streaming business model, the service will effectively compete with AVOD (ad-supported video on demand) players in terms of aggregating both older and niche content. AVOD services &#8212; like Tubi, Pluto TV, The Roku Channel, IMDb TV, and others &#8212; also help users who can&#8217;t find anything they want to watch on their preferred paid subscription apps. And they often aid consumers who are in search of a particular movie or show but don&#8217;t want to pay for a rental. Struum believes by aggregating content it can encourage these users to pay for yet another subscription.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, Struum will have to convince users to change their existing TV habits in order to find success, and that&#8217;s a risky bet.<\/p>\n<p>But Struum believes the fragmentation of the streaming market may actually work in its favor. As consumers get fed up so many different services and content that jumps around as rights owners forge new licensing agreements, Struum could step in as someone&#8217;s fourth subscription.<\/p>\n<p>We view ourselves as the ultimate complementary service and a perfect fit for TV and film lovers who are increasingly frustrated by the costs, complexity and effort required to discover and watch what they want,&#8221; noted Struum CEO Lauren DeViller.<\/p>\n<p>Struum is backed by a multi-million-dollar investment from former Disney CEO Michael Eisner through his firm, Tornante Company.

data, so much as moving it to where it&#8217;s needed. Enter <a href=\"https:\/\/airbyte.io\/\">Airbyte<\/a>, an early stage startup that is building an open source data integration platform to help solve that problem. Today the company announced a $26 million Series A, just a couple of months after announcing its $5.2 million seed round.<\/p>\n<p>Benchmark led the investment with help from 8VC, Accel, SV Angel, Y Combinator and multiple tech industry luminaries. The company has raised over $31 million, all of it coming this year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is an open source data integration platform to bring data wherever it is, whether it&#8217;s a database, a file or an API into the destination of your choice whether it is a data warehouse or a data lake,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Michel Tricot told TechCrunch. This involves building connectors to various data types. The company is providing the open source platform and an SDK to build connectors, and inviting the community to add their own connectors, while building some too.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Things are moving quickly for the startup. In addition to the funding, it released its Connected Development Kit or CDK earlier this month. &#8220;It&#8217;s a local framework that enables you to build a custom connector within two hours instead of two or three days,&#8221; company co-founder John Lafleur explained. To this point, the community has contributed approximately 20% of the platform&#8217;s 70 connectors, but the two founders expect that percentage to increase as the CDK has time to spread in the community.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IryrKEiEak\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/31\/hex-lands-5-5m-seed-to-help-data-scientists-share-data-across-the-company\/\">Hex lands $5.5M seed to help data scientists share data across the company<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Hex lands $5.5M seed to help data scientists share data across the company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/31\/hex-lands-5-5m-seed-to-help-data-scientists-share-data-across-the-company\/embed\/#?secret=IryrKEiEak\" data-secret=\"IryrKEiEak\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Airbyte was founded just last year and the company plans to spend this year trying to expand the rapidly growing community, which is up to 1200 members and 500 active users to this point.

The company is truly global with employees across the world \u2014 and it did that before COVID-19 made remote working cool.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Things got so much better when we stopped viewing ourselves as a Silicon Valley company. We basically said, no, we&#8217;re just a global company,&#8221; CEO David Barrett told TechCrunch. That globalism led to it opening a major office in \u2014 of all places \u2014a small town in rural Michigan. That Ironwood expansion would eventually lead to a cultural makeover that would see the company broadly abandon its focus on the Bay Area, expanding from a headquarters in Portland to offices around the globe.<\/p>\n<p>It makes sense that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/10\/expensify-ec1-origin\/\">a company founded by internet pirates<\/a> would let its workforce live anywhere they please and however they want to. Yet, how does it manage to make it all work well enough to reach $100 million in annual revenue with just a tad more than 100 employees?<\/p>\n<p>As I described in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/18\/expensify-ec1-culture\/\">Part 2 of this EC-1<\/a>, that staffing efficiency is partly due to its culture and who it hires. It&#8217;s also because it has attracted top talent from across the world by giving them benefits like the option to work remotely all year as well as paying SF-level salaries even to those not based in the tech hub. It&#8217;s also got annual fully paid month-long &#8220;workcations&#8221; for every employee, their partner and kids.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the real story is how a company can become untethered from its original geography, willing to adapt to new places and new cultures, and ultimately, give up the past while building the future.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Expensify may be the most ambitious software company ever to mostly abandon the Bay Area as the center of its operations.

All told, the release includes more than 100 new features or upgrades, with the goal of increasing and diversifying the supply side of the business to not only fuel overall growth but also meet the changing demands of guests.<\/p>\n<p>The changes come in response to the way travel has evolved during the pandemic; Airbnb as a company has changed, too.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch sat down with Brian Chesky, Airbnb co-founder and CEO, to discuss the future of travel, how his company worked to support a changing market and what it was like leading the world&#8217;s biggest travel startup during a global pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to read more about today&#8217;s update, you can check out our article on it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/airbnb-doubles-down-on-flexible-search-improves-the-host-flow-in-preparation-for-summer-2021\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The TL;DR version is as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New search flexibility around dates, destinations and matching criteria.<\/li>\n<li>Easier onboarding and efficiency for hosts.<\/li>\n<li>Increased and enhanced customer support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>From a very high level, the first change is designed to help drive demand, the second to boost supply and the third to keep both sides of the marketplace healthy.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s interview with Chesky follows. It has been lightly edited for length and clarity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: A lot of the announcement today comes from the fact that we&#8217;ve been through more than a year of a pandemic and travel has evolved, and you are responding to that. As a CEO, you&#8217;ve been through so many big moments, from the IPO to the early launch days to a long regulatory journey. Where does leading a company during a pandemic fit into the CEO journey for you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Brian Chesky:<\/strong> Yeah, Jordan, I would probably say that I never thought we would do anything as crazy as starting Airbnb. I kind of assumed, until last year, that that would probably be the craziest story I&#8217;ll ever have. Little did I know that a travel company in a pandemic might even be crazier than starting a company based on strangers living together. I kind of feel like I&#8217;m now 39 going on 49. It was definitely the craziest year ever.<\/p>\n<p>Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say it&#8217;s like driving a car. You can&#8217;t go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, and expect nothing really bad to happen. Now imagine you&#8217;re going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving, and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TechCrunch sat down with Brian Chesky, Airbnb co-founder and CEO, to discuss the future of travel and what it was like leading the world&#8217;s biggest travel startup during a global pandemic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24273062,"featured_media":1056043,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"dde3f8bf-581a-3105-9390-00cc3430bc48"},"categories":[576594449,17396],"tags":[19239773,37897360,576881022],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/brian-chesky-airbnb-2-of-6.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3hR6bGc","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.16,"featured":true,"subtitle":"How the travel company rebuilt its business during the pandemic, and what it sees in the future of travel","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[24273062],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2156667"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2156667"}],"version-history":[{"count":15,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2156667\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2157198,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2156667\/revisions\/2157198"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/24273062"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2156667&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/24273062"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1056043"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2156667"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2156667"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2156667"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2156667"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2156667"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2156667"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2156667"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":24273062,"name":"Jordan Crook","url":"","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/jordan-crook\/","slug":"jordan-crook","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3311dfd2a72b8ea26707777a79acda77?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3311dfd2a72b8ea26707777a79acda77?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3311dfd2a72b8ea26707777a79acda77?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"homepage":"http:\/\/techcrunch.com","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jordanrcrook","facebook":"","linkedin":"","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/jordan-crook"},"position":"Managing Editor","cbDescription":"<p>Jordan Crook is a Managing Editor based out of Brooklyn, NY.

additional support when using PyTorch on Azure. It&#8217;s basically Microsoft&#8217;s commercial support offering for PyTorch.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pytorch.org\/\">PyTorch<\/a> is a Python-centric open-source machine learning framework with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing. It was originally developed by Facebook and is, at least to some degree, comparable to Google&#8217;s popular TensorFlow framework.<\/p>\n<p>Frank X. Shaw, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate VP for communications, described the new PyTorch Enterprise service as providing developers with &#8220;a more reliable production experience for organizations using PyTorch in their data sciences work.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>With PyTorch Enterprise, members of Microsoft&#8217;s Premier and Unified support program will get benefits like prioritized requests, hands-on support and solutions for hotfixes, bugs and security patches, Shaw explained. Every year, Microsoft will also select one PyTorch version for long-term support.<\/p>\n<p>Azure already made it <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/develop\/pytorch\/\">relatively easy to use PyTorch<\/a>, and Microsoft has long invested in the library by, for example, taking over the development of PyTorch for Windows <a href=\"https:\/\/pytorch.org\/blog\/microsoft-becomes-maintainer-of-the-windows-version-of-pytorch\/\">last year<\/a>. As Microsoft noted in today&#8217;s announcement, the latest release of PyTorch will be integrated with Azure Machine Learning and the company promises to feed back to the public PyTorch distribution the PyTorch code it gets from developers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TCFgTT5AZS\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/31\/5-machine-learning-essentials-non-technical-leaders-need-to-understand\/\">5 machine learning essentials nontechnical leaders need to understand<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;5 machine learning essentials nontechnical leaders need to understand&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/31\/5-machine-learning-essentials-non-technical-leaders-need-to-understand\/embed\/#?secret=TCFgTT5AZS\" data-secret=\"TCFgTT5AZS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Enterprise support will be available for PyTorch version 1.8.1 and up on Windows 10 and a number of popular Linux distributions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This new enterprise-level offering by Microsoft closes an important gap. PyTorch gives our researchers unprecedented flexibility in designing their models and running their experiments,&#8221; said Jeremy Jancsary, senior principal research scientist at Nuance. &#8220;Serving these models in production, however, can be a challenge. The direct involvement of Microsoft lets us deploy new versions of PyTorch to Azure with confidence.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With this new offering, Microsoft is taking a page out of the open-source monetization playbook for startups by offering additional services on top of an open-source project. Since PyTorch wasn&#8217;t developed by a startup, only to have a major cloud provider then offer its own commercial version on top of the open-source code, this feels like a rather uncontroversial move.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/microsoft-build-2021\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/microsoft-build-2021-banner.jpg\" alt=\"read\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Microsoft today announced PyTorch Enterprise, a new Azure service that provides developers with additional support when using PyTorch on Azure.

huge surprises &#8212; but there&#8217;s one announcement that will surely make developers&#8217; ears perk up: The company is now using OpenAI&#8217;s massive GPT-3 natural language model in its no-code\/low-code Power Apps service to translate spoken text into code in its recently announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform\/\">Power Fx language<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now don&#8217;t get carried away. You&#8217;re not going to develop the next TikTok while only using natural language. Instead, what Microsoft is doing here is taking some of the low-code aspects of a tool like Power Apps and using AI to essentially turn those into no-code experiences, too. For now, the focus here is on Power Apps formulas, which despite the low-code nature of the service, is something you&#8217;ll have to write sooner or later if you want to build an app of any sophistication.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Using an advanced AI model like this can help our low-code tools become even more widely available to an even bigger audience by truly becoming what we call no code,&#8221; said Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president for Microsoft\u2019s low-code application platform.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8I6xrknY62\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform\/\">Microsoft launches Power Fx, a new open source low-code language<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Microsoft launches Power Fx, a new open source low-code language&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform\/embed\/#?secret=8I6xrknY62\" data-secret=\"8I6xrknY62\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In practice, this looks like the citizen programmer writing &#8220;find products where the name starts with &#8216;kids&#8217; &#8221; &#8212; and Power Apps then rendering that as <em>&#8220;Filter(\u2018BC Orders\u2019 Left(\u2018Product Name\u2019,4)=&#8221;Kids&#8221;)&#8221;<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Because Microsoft is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/22\/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership\/\">an investor in OpenAI<\/a>, it&#8217;s no surprise the company chose its model to power this experience.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2156679\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2156679\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2156679\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2156679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Microsoft<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while this makes programming easier, Microsoft itself stresses that users still have to understand the logic of the application they are building. &#8220;The features don\u2019t replace the need for a person to understand the code they are implementing but are designed to assist people who are learning the Power Fx programming language and help them choose the right formulas to get the result they need. That can dramatically expand access to more advanced app building and more rapidly train people to use low code tools,&#8221; the company explains in today&#8217;s announcement.<\/p>\n<p>To some degree, this isn&#8217;t all that different from using the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/power-bi\/natural-language\/q-and-a-intro\">natural language query functions<\/a> that are now available in tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcommunity.microsoft.com\/t5\/excel-blog\/introducing-natural-language-queries-in-ideas\/ba-p\/1594687\">Excel<\/a>, PowerBI or <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/ai-machine-learning\/analyzing-text-in-a-google-sheet-using-cloud-natural-language-api-and-apps-script\">Google Sheets<\/a>. These, too, translate natural language into a formula, after all. GPT-3 is probably a bit more sophisticated than this and capable of understanding more complex queries, but translating natural language into formulas isn&#8217;t all that new.<\/p>\n<p>The long-term promise here, though, is for tools like this to become smarter over time and be able to handle more complicated programming tasks. But that&#8217;s a big step up from what is essentially a translation problem, though. More complex queries require more of an understanding of a program as a whole. A formula, for the most part, is a pretty self-contained statement but a similar model that could generate &#8220;real&#8221; code would have to contend with a lot more context.<\/p>\n<p>These new features will go live in public preview in English to users in North America by the end of June.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3g2FyWL9bu\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/07\/no-code-will-define-the-next-generation-of-software\/\">&#8216;No code&#8217;

Edge browser can now start up faster and put your tabs to sleep"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">At its annual Build conference today, Microsoft announced a couple of new features for version 91 of its Edge browser that, like so much at Build this year, aren&#8217;t earth-shattering (developer velocity!) but nice quality-of-life upgrades for its users. Since Microsoft develops Edge in the open, these may also feel familiar to those who keep a close eye on the Edge roadmap &#8212; indeed, I think I&#8217;ve seen most of these in Edge 90 already&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>One new feature is Startup Boost, which allows Edge to start up almost instantly. The way Microsoft does this is pretty straightforward. It simply loads some of the core Edge processes whenever you boot up your Windows machine, so when you task Edge with starting up, there isn&#8217;t all that much work left to do. This shouldn&#8217;t have too much of an effect on your Windows 10 bootup time, so it&#8217;s probably a trade-off worth making, but I also can&#8217;t recall anybody complaining about browser startup times in the last couple of years either.<\/p>\n<p>The other new feature is &#8220;sleeping tabs,&#8221; which does pretty much what you expect it to do. It puts your tabs to sleep so they don&#8217;t use up unnecessary memory and CPU cycles.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RDYdmp8WO1\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/03\/browsers-are-interesting-again\/\">Browsers are interesting again<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Browsers are interesting again&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/03\/browsers-are-interesting-again\/embed\/#?secret=RDYdmp8WO1\" data-secret=\"RDYdmp8WO1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Microsoft first announced that it was testing this feature <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.windows.com\/msedgedev\/2020\/12\/09\/sleeping-tabs-beta-performance\/\">back in December<\/a>.

launches new tools for Teams developers"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">At its (virtual) Build conference today, Microsoft launched a number of new features, tools and services for developers who want to integrate their services with Teams, the company&#8217;s Slack competitor. It&#8217;s no secret that Microsoft basically looks at Teams, which now has about 145 million daily active users, as the new hub for employees to get work done, so it&#8217;s no surprise that it wants third-party developers to bring their services right to Teams as well. And to do so, it&#8217;s now offering a set of new tools that will make this easier and enable developers to build new user experiences in Teams.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on here, but maybe the most important news is the launch of the enhanced Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This essentially enables developers to build apps easier and faster &#8212; and to build very powerful apps tapping into the rich Microsoft stack,&#8221; Microsoft group program manager Archana Saseetharan explained. &#8220;With the updated toolkit [&#8230;], we enable flexibility for developers. We want to meet developers where they are.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2156680\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Shared-Stage-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2156680\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2156680\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Shared-Stage-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"562\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2156680\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Microsoft<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The toolkit offers support for tools and frameworks like React, SharePoint and .NET. Some of the updates the team enabled with this release are integration with Aure Functions, the SharePoint Framework integration and a single-line integration with the Microsoft Graph. Microsoft is also making it easier for developers to integrate an authorization workflow into their Teams apps. &#8220;Login is the first kind of experience of any user with an app &#8212; and most of the drop-offs happen there,&#8221; Saseetharan said. &#8220;So [single-sign on] is something we completely are pushing hard on.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The team also launched a new Developer Portal for Microsoft Teams that makes it easier for developers to register and configure their apps from a single tool. ISVs will also be able to use the new portal to offer their apps for in-Teams purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Other new Teams features for developers include ways for developers to build real-time multi-user experiences like whiteboards and project boards, for example, as well as a new meeting event API to build meeting-related workflows for when a meeting starts and ends, for example, as well as new features for the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/08\/microsoft-makes-teams-video-meetings-less-tiring-with-its-new-together-mode\/\">Teams Together mode<\/a> that will let developers design their own Together experiences.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few other new features here as well, but what it all comes down to is that Microsoft wants developers to consider Teams as a viable platform for their services &#8212; and with 145 million daily active users, that&#8217;s potentially a lucrative way for software firms to get their services in front of a new audience.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Teams is enabling a new class of apps called collaborative apps,&#8221; said Karan Nigam, Microsoft&#8217;s director of product marketing for Teams. &#8220;We are uniquely positioned to bring the richness to the collaboration space &#8212; a ton of innovation to the extensibility side to make apps richer, making it easier with the toolkit update, and then have a single-stop shop with the developer portal where the entire lifecycle can be managed. Ultimately, for a developer, they don&#8217;t have to go to multiple places, it&#8217;s one single flow from the business perspective for them as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"reIHnSNVaD\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/08\/microsoft-makes-teams-video-meetings-less-tiring-with-its-new-together-mode\/\">Microsoft makes Teams video meetings less tiring with its new Together mode<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Microsoft makes Teams video meetings less tiring with its new Together mode&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/08\/microsoft-makes-teams-video-meetings-less-tiring-with-its-new-together-mode\/embed\/#?secret=reIHnSNVaD\" data-secret=\"reIHnSNVaD\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/microsoft-build-2021\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/microsoft-build-2021-banner.jpg\" alt=\"read\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At its (virtual) Build conference today, Microsoft launched a number of new features, tools and services for developers who want to integrate their services with Teams, the company&#8217;s Slack competitor.

Arc<\/a> multi-cloud service.<\/p>\n<p>Azure Arc, similar to tools like Google&#8217;s Anthos or AWS&#8217;s upcoming <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/eks\/eks-anywhere\/\">EKS Anywhere<\/a>, provides businesses with a single tool to manage their container clusters across clouds and on-premises data centers. Since its launch back in late 2019, Arc enabled some of the core Azure services to run directly in these clusters as well, though the early focus was on a small set of data services, with the team also later adding some machine learning tools to Arc as well. With today&#8217;s update, the company is greatly expanding this set of containerized Azure services that work with Arc.<\/p>\n<p>These new services include <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/services\/app-service\/\">Azure App Service<\/a> for building and managing web apps and APIs, <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/services\/functions\/\">Azure Functions<\/a> for event-driven programming, <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/services\/logic-apps\/\">Azure Logic Apps<\/a> for building automated workflows, <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/services\/event-grid\/\">Azure Event Grid<\/a> for event routing and <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/services\/api-management\/\">Azure API Management<\/a> for&#8230; you guessed it&#8230; managing internal and external APIs.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The app services are now Azure Arc-enabled, which means customers can deploy Web Apps, Functions, API gateways, Logic Apps and Event Grid services on pre-provisioned Kubernetes clusters,&#8221; Microsoft explained in its annual &#8220;Book of News&#8221; for this year&#8217;s Build. &#8220;This takes advantage of features including deployment slots for A\/B testing, storage queue triggers and out-of-box connectors from the app services, regardless of run location.

anti-surveillance campaigners in Europe by failing to find that bulk interception of digital comms is inherently incompatible with human rights law &#8212; which enshrines individual rights to privacy and freedom of expression.<\/p>\n<p>However today&#8217;s Grand Chamber <a href=\"https:\/\/hudoc.echr.coe.int\/eng-press#{&quot;itemid&quot;:[&quot;003-7028496-9484349&quot;]}\">judgement<\/a> <a

with what the judges describe as &#8220;end-to-end safeguards&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Governments in Europe that fail to do so are opening such laws up to further legal challenge under the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The Grand Chamber ruling also confirms that the UK&#8217;s historic surveillance regime &#8212; under the Regulation of

Looking at the dissents, it does not look good for anti-surveillance campaigners: &#39;with the present judgment the Strasbourg Court has just opened the gates for an electronic \u201cBig Brother\u201d in Europe&#39; <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/1HqKz64qS5\">https:\/\/t.co\/1HqKz64qS5<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Michael Veale (@mikarv) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mikarv\/status\/1397123680883314689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 25, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Per the court, &#8216;end-to-end&#8217; safeguards means that bulk intercept powers need to involve assessments at each stage of the process of the necessity and proportionality of the measures being taken; that bulk interception should be subject to independent authorisation at the outset, when the object and scope of the operation are being defined; and that the operation should be subject to supervision and independent &#8216;ex post facto&#8217; review.<\/p>\n<p>The Grand Chamber judgement identified a number of deficiencies with the bulk regime operated in the UK at the time of RIPA &#8212; including that bulk interception had been authorised by the Secretary of State, rather than by a body independent of the executive; categories of search terms defining the kinds of communications that would become liable for examination had not been included in the application for a warrant; and search terms linked to an individual (e.g. specific identifiers such as an email address) had not been subject to prior internal authorisation.<\/p>\n<p>The court also found that the UK&#8217;s<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> bulk intercept regime had breached Article 10 (freedom of expression) because it had not contained sufficient protections for confidential journalistic material.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>While the regime used for obtaining comms data from communication service providers was found to have violated Articles 8 (right to privacy and family life\/comms) and 10 &#8220;as it had not been in accordance with the law&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>However, the court held that the regime by which the UK could request intelligence from foreign governments and\/or intelligence agencies had had sufficient safeguards in place to protect against abuse and to ensure that UK authorities had not used such requests as a means of circumventing their duties under domestic law and the Convention.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The Court considered that, owing to the multitude of threats States face in modern society, operating a bulk interception regime did not in and of itself violate the Convention,&#8221; it added in a press release.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The RIPA regime has since replaced by the UK&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/29\/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption\/\">Investigatory Powers Act<\/a> (IPA) &#8212; which put bulk intercept powers explicitly into law (albeit with claimed layers of oversight).<\/p>\n<p>The IPA has also been subject to a number of human rights challenges &#8212; and in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-43928147\">2018<\/a> the government was ordered by the UK High Court to revise parts of the law which had been found to be incompatible with human rights law.<\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s Grand Chamber judgement relates specifically to RIPA and to a number of legal challenges brought against the UK&#8217;s mass surveillance regime by journalists and privacy and digital rights campaigners in the wake of the 2013 mass surveillance revelations by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden which the ECHR heard simultaneously.<\/p>\n<p>In a similar ruling <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/13\/uks-mass-surveillance-regime-violated-human-rights-law-finds-echr\/\">back in 2018<\/a> the lower Chamber found some aspects of the UK&#8217;s regime violated human rights law &#8212; with a majority vote then finding that its <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">bulk interception regime had violated Article 8 because there was insufficient oversight (such as of selectors and filtering; and of search and selection of intercepted communications for examination; as well as inadequate safeguards governing the selection of related comms data).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Human rights campaigners followed up by requesting and securing a referral to the Grand Chamber &#8212; which has now handed down its view.<\/p>\n<p>It <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">unanimously <\/span>found there had been a violation of Article 8 <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">in respect of the regime for obtaining communications data from communication service providers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But by <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">12 votes to 5 it ruled there had been no violation of Article 8 in respect of the UK\u2019s regime for requesting intercepted material from foreign governments and intelligence agencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In another <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">unanimous vote the Grand Chamber found <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">there had been a violation of Article 10, concerning both the bulk interception regime and the regime for obtaining communications data from comms service providers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But, again, by <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;

This would be the opposite of what the founding fathers wanted for Europe when they signed the Convention in 1950.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In further remarks on the judgement, Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, added: &#8220;Mass surveillance damages democracies under the cloak of defending them, and we welcome the Court\u2019s acknowledgement of this. As one judge put it, we are at great risk of living in an electronic &#8216;Big Brother&#8217; in Europe. We welcome the judgment that the UK\u2019s surveillance regime was unlawful, but the missed opportunity for the Court to prescribe clearer limitations and safeguards mean that risk is current and real.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We will continue our work to protect privacy, from parliament to the courts, until intrusive mass surveillance practices are ended,&#8221; she added.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/privacyinternational.org\/press-release\/4522\/human-rights-groups-win-european-court-human-rights-claim-uk-mass-surveillance\">Privacy International<\/a> &#8212; another party to the case &#8212; sought to put a more positive spin on the outcome, saying the Grand Chamber goes further than the ECHR&#8217;s 2018 ruling by &#8220;providing for new and stronger safeguards, adding a new requirement of prior independent or judicial authorisation for bulk interception&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Authorisation must be meaningful, rigorous and check for proper &#8216;end-to-end safeguards&#8217;,&#8221; it added in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Also commenting publicly, the Open Rights Group&#8217;s executive director, Jim Killock, said: \u201cThe court has shown that the UK Government\u2019s legal framework was weak and inadequate when we took them to court with Big Brother Watch and Constanze Kurz in 2013. The court has set out clear criteria for assessing future bulk interception regimes, but we believe these will need to be developed into harder red lines in future judgments, if bulk interception is not to be abused.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs the court sets out, bulk interception powers are a great power, secretive in nature, and hard to keep in check. We are far from confident that today\u2019s bulk interception is sufficiently safeguarded, while the technical capacities continue to deepen. GCHQ continues to share technology platforms and raw data with the US,&#8221; Killock went on to say, couching the judgment as &#8220;an important step on a long journey&#8221;.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6LZCmz7aEX\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/13\/uks-mass-surveillance-regime-violated-human-rights-law-finds-echr\/\">UK&#8217;s mass surveillance regime violated human rights law, finds ECHR<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;UK&#8217;s mass surveillance regime violated human rights law, finds ECHR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/13\/uks-mass-surveillance-regime-violated-human-rights-law-finds-echr\/embed\/#?secret=6LZCmz7aEX\" data-secret=\"6LZCmz7aEX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4MEYyOnIgM\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits\/\">Europe&#8217;s top court confirms no mass surveillance without limits<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court confirms no mass surveillance without limits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits\/embed\/#?secret=4MEYyOnIgM\" data-secret=\"4MEYyOnIgM\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XsAFFcxjMu\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/29\/uk-high-court-rejects-human-rights-challenge-to-bulk-snooping-powers\/\">UK High Court rejects human rights challenge to bulk snooping powers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;UK High Court rejects human rights challenge to bulk snooping powers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/29\/uk-high-court-rejects-human-rights-challenge-to-bulk-snooping-powers\/embed\/#?secret=XsAFFcxjMu\" data-secret=\"XsAFFcxjMu\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The highest chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has delivered a blow to anti-surveillance campaigners in Europe by failing to find that bulk interception of digital comms is inherently incompatible with human rights law &#8212; which enshrines individual rights to privacy and freedom of expression.

Space acquires StratSpace in pursuit of becoming a turnkey space service"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Even as 2021 shapes up to see a record number of launches, demand is growing fast. Companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/phantomspace.com\/\">Phantom Space Corporation<\/a> aim to fill it with mass manufacturing techniques never yet seen in the space industry. Now the company has acquired StratSpace, a satellite program designer and manager, Phantom Space announced Tuesday. It&#8217;s a critical step toward building out a turnkey space transportation and manufacturing service, Phantom Space co-founder Michal Prywata told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[StratSpace] has all the know-how, all the tools, the satellite structures, communication systems that can make a spacecraft operate,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhich is very critical for us, because we want to be one of the first companies that covers that full spectrum of service from start to finish.\u201d The company declined to disclose the terms of the acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>Phantom Space\u2019s bet is that combining a mass rocket manufacturing strategy with acquisitions that position it as a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; will help bring down the cost of space access. Prywata said the company\u2019s aiming to charge $4 million for a dedicated launch that would bring up to 450 kilograms to low Earth orbit.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about hundreds to potentially thousands a year,\u201d Prywata said, referring to the number of launches the company eventually hopes to achieve. \u201cAs of right now, the market certainly supports hundreds of launches a year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re big aspirations for a company that has not yet begun even flight testing a rocket model. Phantom Space said it is outsourcing many components, like the engine and avionics system, that can take years to develop, to get it there. For other components and services, it&#8217;s looking to use an acquisition strategy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat&#8217;s why we&#8217;re looking at acquisitions pretty aggressively because we feel there&#8217;s an opportunity now to start integrating these types of technologies and companies within one umbrella and create this overall infrastructure of a company that can take ideas and bring them to space,\u201d he said. That includes building satellites, integration, launch and data communication. \u201cWe&#8217;re trying to cover that full spectrum, where we can help other companies that have some application that they want to launch into space, we can help them get there, because we have all these specific pieces that can make it all happen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Phantom Space is aiming to launch its two-stage Daytona rocket for the first time in the first quarter of 2023, with stage-level testing commencing in early 2022. Daytona, the company&#8217;s &#8220;workhorse&#8221; launch vehicle, comes in at 61 feet in height and can carry 450 kilograms to LEO on eight engines. While the Daytona is totally expendable, the company has plans to reuse its larger Laguna rocket model.<\/p>\n<p>The company has signed a right of entry for Space Launch Complex 5 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, which will likely be the location of its first launches.

Road conditions in Chinese cities are often much more complicated than in the United States, even on sidewalks and bike lanes thanks to unpredictable pedestrians, unleashed pets and reckless scooter riders.<\/p>\n<p>Importantly, the rules also stipulate that the robots need to have safety drivers &#8220;on the spot and remotely.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2157081\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2157081\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2157081 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2157081\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Neolix&#8217;s delivery robot \/ Photo: Neolix via WeChat<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">JD.com says its technology allows every remote safety driver to monitor up to 50 operating delivery robots simultaneously.

Existing investors Hanaco Ventures, Spider Capital and Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator also participated in the round.<\/p>\n<p>Hyro is an enterprise application, currently aimed at the healthcare sector but with eyes on new verticals, that adds an intelligent layer of voice chat or text chat to any application or website.<\/p>\n<p>The company calls itself an adaptive communications platform, which essentially means that customers use plug-and-play tools to get information to end-users in a conversational way, whether that be voice or chat. It can integrate with contact centers, chatbots, SMS and other forms of communication. Essentially, Hyro targets information-heavy industries that often have to communicate with end-users.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This type of scenario, in the words of co-founder Israel Krush, usually leads to a terrible experience for the end user and a costly, inefficient process for the organization. The problem was no more apparent than in the healthcare sector during the pandemic. End users would flood platforms for information regarding the virus, the vaccine, testing, etc., but ask those redundant questions in myriad ways. On the enterprise side, the answers to those questions were changing over time.<\/p>\n<p>Hyro allows these organizations to easily edit and change that information and deliver it to end users in an efficient way. But perhaps most importantly, Hyro scrapes information from the website to set up its own conversational tree, so the client doesn&#8217;t have to do a lot of heavy lifting up front.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cTYqkUHMGs\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/25\/airbud-raises-4-million-to-add-a-voice-interface-to-your-website\/\">Airbud raises $4 million to add a voice interface to your website<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Airbud raises $4 million to add a voice interface to your website&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/25\/airbud-raises-4-million-to-add-a-voice-interface-to-your-website\/embed\/#?secret=cTYqkUHMGs\" data-secret=\"cTYqkUHMGs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Krush says that the problem is big, which means that the space is crowded.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/propy-a-blockchain-verified-platform-for-selling-houses-raises-funding-from-tim-draper\/\">wrote about Propy<\/a> using blockchain technology to smooth real-world real estate sales by introducing the concept of smart contracts. Propy was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/an-entire-real-estate-deal-takes-place-online-using-cryptocurrency-technology-1506462545\">the first<\/a> blockchain startup to make that work. Now the company is pushing the boundaries again, by <em>auctioning a real apartment as an NFT<\/em>. Although one might want to brush this aside as a stunt, the event is designed to make the point that it could well be done legally. And, by golly, they are going to try.<\/p>\n<p>The auction will be of the NFT attached to a modern, brand new, one-bedroom apartment in Kiev, Ukraine, that Propy previously made history with by making it the first-ever blockchain-based real estate sale.<\/p>\n<p>The NFT created by Propy will, it says, transfer real ownership of the property. Just in case you haven&#8217;t been paying attention, NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are cryptographic &#8220;tokens&#8221; that represent a unique asset \u2014 such as a piece of art, music or other collectibles \u2014 and certify ownership digitally. NFTs have set the crypto-world alight with their potential to be applied to just about anything, including a work of art by Banksy which was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/artanddesign\/2021\/mar\/09\/nfts-flying-cats-burning-banksy-digital-art-crypto-art-bitcoin-rocketing\">then burnt<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Once someone has won the NFT of the apartment at auction, the NFT will include access to the ownership transfer paperwork; a digital artwork NFT by a popular Kiev graffiti artist, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/chizz.xr\/\">Chizz<\/a> (a physical painting of the digital artwork is painted on a wall of the apartment) and the apartment pictures. But obviously, the apartment is the main asset here.<\/p>\n<p>The auction itself will happen over a 24-hour period, with the initial listing starting at $20,000. Details for the NFT sale are <a href=\"https:\/\/propy.com\/browse\/propy-nft\/\">available here<\/a> and will be updated with any new information as the auction proceeds.<\/p>\n<p>The apartment in question is currently owned by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/arrington\">Michael Arrington<\/a>, founder of this very news site, and now a crypto investor with <a href=\"http:\/\/arringtonxrpcapital.com\/\">Arrington XRP Capital<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Investors in Propy &#8212; which says it has so far processed $1 billion worth of transactions via its platform &#8212; include Arrington himself <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/propy-a-blockchain-verified-platform-for-selling-houses-raises-funding-from-tim-draper\/\">and Tim Draper<\/a>, former founder of DFJ.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LCt8BtGXbo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/propy-a-blockchain-verified-platform-for-selling-houses-raises-funding-from-tim-draper\/\">Propy, a blockchain-verified platform for selling houses, raises funding from Tim Draper<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Propy, a blockchain-verified platform for selling houses, raises funding from Tim Draper&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/propy-a-blockchain-verified-platform-for-selling-houses-raises-funding-from-tim-draper\/embed\/#?secret=LCt8BtGXbo\" data-secret=\"LCt8BtGXbo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy said: \u201cThis NFT will go down in history. For Propy it is a major milestone in leveraging the promise of blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFT) to achieve &#8216;self-driving&#8217; real estate transactions and real estate participation in the decentralized finance economy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how this is all going to work: Arrington has signed legal papers designed by Propy\u2019s lawyers for the NFT to transfer ownership to a future buyer. Propy then conducts the NFT auction and receives payment in cryptocurrency. The winner in the auction becomes the owner within a minute, after filling out KYC details.<\/p>\n<p>The Kiev property is owned by a USA-based entity, and when the auction completes, the new owner of the NFT becomes the owner of the entity and thus the property itself. This process is repeated every time the NFT attached to the property is resold.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview with me, Karayaneva said: \u201cWe were brainstorming and this appeared to be a natural development of our white paper of 2017. And in fact, many things we transact, real estate, via property, we are actually already kind of doing NFTs, but with our unique smart contracts. But now the NFT concept provides a different approach, where a property can be transferred between two wallets, peer to peer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThus we do not need to change the name of the owner in the land registry. And this applies to many countries, as well as the United States. This model will work for the United States, and overall, there is this notion of buying real estate via LLC in the United States to preserve the privacy of the owner.<\/p>\n<p>Over the same call, Arrington added: \u201cComing at this from a crypto angle, we\u2019ve seen what happens how DeFi gets plugged into credit markets. If I have an NFT or any DeFi asset I can then borrow against it, without a middleman. Right now, if I have a real piece of real estate, there is no way for me to borrow against it, without a middleman, because I have to go through a bank and get a mortgage or whatever. And it&#8217;s also the friction, all of the costs in terms of speed and how long it takes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf we can find a way to plug real estate and other real-world assets into DeFi, I think that the amount of credit that can be created around that is in the trillions, eventually. And so I think that has to happen. The questions around this are legal and regulatory\u2026 The legal stuff around this is tough, and so Propy has done a lot of work with that.
